**They control the algorithm. The algorithm controls you. Break the chain.**

AI systems now make decisions about your loans, job applications, social media feeds, and voting recommendations. But resistance isn't futileâ€”it's essential. Here's your arsenal.

## The Control Matrix

**Where AI Controls You**:
- **Social Media**: Feed algorithms shape your worldview
- **Finance**: Credit scores determine your economic opportunities
- **Employment**: AI filters job applications and performance reviews
- **News**: Recommendation systems control information flow
- **Shopping**: Price discrimination based on personal data
- **Healthcare**: Treatment recommendations influenced by profit algorithms
- **Legal**: Predictive policing and sentencing algorithms
- **Democracy**: Micro-targeted political advertising

**The Result**: A society where algorithms optimize for corporate profit, not human flourishing.
